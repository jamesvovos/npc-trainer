# NLP Neural Network Research Project.

## _Implementation using PyTorch and spaCy._

Inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpWeNzfSUHw&list=LL&index=37

## Installation Guide

PyTorch installation instructions [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/)
spaCy installation instructions [spaCy website](https://spacy.io/)

## 1. Install PyTorch

Install `PyTorch`

```sh
$pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

## 2. Install spaCy and dependencies

![spaCyImage](https://spacy.io/_next/static/media/social_default.96b04585.jpg)
For spaCy NLP library installation:

Install setup tools:

```sh
$pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
```

Install `spaCy` NLP library:

```sh
$pip install -U spacy
```

Add model:

```sh
$python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

## Features

- Ability to pre-process text using NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, etc.
- Implementation of a feed forward neural network model using PyTorch.
- Modify JSON file or inject JSON via API to train model.
- Add custom tags and modify NLP pipeline using custom components and named entity recognition patterns (NER)
- Ability to trade out 'bag of words' and replace with word vectors, etc.
- Will be extending the use case to test different NLP techniques.
- Building API to create dynamic NPC characters in games.

## Tech Stack

Tech the project uses:

- [Python3] - High-level programming language
- [PyTorch] - Machine learning framework
- [spaCy.io] - Industrial-strength natural language processing library

## Customize

Have a look at [data/training-data.json](https://github.com/jamesvovos/nlp-neural-network-project/blob/master/data/training-data.json) . You can customize it according to your own use case. Just define a new `tag`, possible `patterns`, and possible `responses` for the AI to pick up on.

```sh
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": [
        "Hi",
        "Hey",
        "How are you",
        "Is anyone there?",
        "Hello",
        "Good day"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "Hey :-)",
        "Hello, thanks for visiting",
        "Hi there, what can I do for you?",
        "Hi there, how can I help?"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

You have to re-run the training whenever this file is modified. In the [main.py](https://github.com/jamesvovos/nlp-neural-network-project/blob/master/main.py) file just toggle the `training_required` bool to `True`

```sh
import spacy
from processor import DataProcessor
from chat import ChatBot

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')

# NOTE: toggle if you want to retrain the model
training_required: bool = False

# create NLP model object and pass it the text from file
data = DataProcessor(training_required)

# perform NLP pipeline process and return the updated data processor object
data_processor = data.initialise_data()

# setup chatbot interface
chatbot = ChatBot(data_processor)
chatbot.create_chat()
```
